One of HakerRank problem

To Do:
You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n.

Solution:
-Have multiple for loops for getting the values in the list.
-Append the value only if sum of i+j+k is not equal to n.
